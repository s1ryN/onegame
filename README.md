# onegame
Repository for all onegame.gg files

This current version is being developed to show some skills and actually show them

## Database

The database currently consists of 6 tables
With the upcoming functionalities it should expand as I am developing the project
The current database is SQL, with a possible change to a NoSQL database like MongoDB

## HTML

All .html files are now turned into .ejs, reasoning is flash messages displaying
All html code will have notes for easier understanding of the code, same as all JS and EJS being used

## CSS
CSS is just a plain old mess, that I will probably clean for better loading speed (nanoseconds matter)

## node.js
server.js is the actual node being used and running on express framework
All the current functionality will be adjusted one day

## TODO

Add EJS to the login page
Fix post loading - loading too many posts on scroll = HW is getting totally damned by this
Redo the homepage - all the posts are currently being loaded by a crazy JS script that dies on edit
Adjust the responsive desing
Add some more features - chats, friends, search, karma, looking for teammates, click on profiles and so on
