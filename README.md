# onegame
Repository for all onegame.gg files
Current problems : 
1. Checking if the credentials to login are right, if wrong, sending a message to user about wrong credentials or any other error during login
2. Sending the user to a page about successful login
3. Posting a Youtube link completely breaks the /post function and kills the server
4. Responsive design is finished only for index 
5. Comments are only in Czech, the ones in English are mostly ChatGPT translating already finished notes or new notes created by the AI
6. It is my first big website project, so most things are done in a weird way
7. There are still some parts missing, like a .sql file to create all the tables if you would want to setup this
8. There is no guide on how to use .env for storing your database password
9. This project is far from finished 
10. Most files for functionality are missing, they will be added with the finished project

Most of these things will be fixed in the next patches or in the future = it may take a month, it may take a year, i dont know
